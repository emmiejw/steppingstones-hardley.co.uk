              <h3>Online Journal</h3>
                <p>
                  We are using a piece of educational software called “Tapestry”. Every child at Stepping Stones will have their own individual learning journal. By logging on with a secure username and password you will be able to access your child’s journal. Parents are only able to view their own child’s journal and all information is stored securely. Tapestry online learning journeys allow you to view your child’s observations and photographs from their time in pre-school. We will also reference your child’s learning to the EYFS profile. This will keep you informed of the areas of learning in which your child is achieving, also, the age band they were working in for the observed activity. Tapestry allows you, as a parent/carer to add observations and photographs of your own ~ as well as share your comments. We love to hear about learning and “WOW moments” from home. Because children play in close proximity with their friends it does not reflect a true picture of their time at Stepping Stones if photographs are only of a single child. Therefore photographs of your child may appear on their friends’ learning journeys.
