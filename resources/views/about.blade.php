            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Stepping Stones Pre-school is a community pre-school and has served the local community for many years. We currently take children from 2 years until school age. ‘The pre-school is run by a voluntary committee, the majority of whom are parents of pre-school children, this ensures that major decision making is in the hands of the parents who use the group. The committee meet on a regular basis, and at its Annual General Meeting in the autumn term, a new committee is elected for the year.

            <h3>FEES</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Fees are reviewed annually and are currently £4.75 per hour (£11.88 per 2.5 hour session) for 2 year olds or £4.30 per hour (£10.75 per 2.5 hour session) for 3-4 year olds</b>, payable by monthly invoice. ach child’s attendance at the group is conditional upon continued payment of their fees and/or eligibility to receive government funding. Any decreases in sessions will require one month’s notice. As our pre-school is a registered charity we rely heavily on prompt payment of fees. It is asked that fees are paid before the end of the month of the invoice. If fees are unpaid, or your child has unauthorised absence from the group, for 2 weeks or more, their name will be removed from the register and their place offered to another child on the waiting list. If, however, you are experiencing financial difficulties please let us know as soon as possible and we will try to help.
            </p>
            <h3>GOVERNMENT FUNDING</h3>
            <p>
                Children are entitled to receive 15 free hours of government funding from the beginning of the term after their third birthday.
                Some parents will be entitled to an extra 15 hours of government funding if they meet certain criteria. Applications or information can be found on the Gov.uk website and, if successful, parents must provide a 30 hour eligibility code and their national insurance number. Please note that we cannot guarantee funded hours, these will be subject to availability. We also offer places to children in receipt of 2 year funding.
            </p>
            <h3>REGISTRATION FEE</h3>
            <p>
                 All new entrants to our pre-school will be required to pay a one-off £20 registration fee. This fee will cover the cost of administration, two taster sessions prior to your child’s start date, a book bag and a t-shirt. The fee will be payable on return of your completed application form.  
            </p>
            <h3>THE PRE-SCHOOL AND PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT</h3>
            <p>
                Research shows that children learn better when their parents are involved. All parents are encouraged to help in the group on a regular basis as it gives them the opportunity to take an active part in the group, to see what happens and to talk about it afterwards with their child. In addition, it provides a valuable opportunity for all children to see their own parents/carers in a new role and is an ideal opportunity for you to view your child’s records. If you have a particular skill which you feel may benefit the group please let us know. if you do not want to come in to help for a whole session please chat to a member of staff - it may be possible for you to come in to read 2 story or share a job experience.
            </p>
            <h3>POLICIES</h3>
            <p>
                    The setting's policies help us to make sure that the service provided by the setting is a high quality one and that being a member of the setting is an enjoyable and beneficial experience for each child and her/his parents.
